# Camp CONNECT Portal
Custom Web Portal for Camp CONNECT - Summer 2020

# Quick Start Guide

Hi! My name is **Shanil Jasani** (Core Tech, All Camps) and I am the Camp CONNECT **Expert** for the Camp CONNECT Portal!

The Portal is a **central location** for participants, facilitators, and staff to access all their camp resources, including:

- A Personal Schedule
- Camp Resources & FAQ
- Camp Support

_This is the first page you’ll see with the three main pieces of the website._

## The first being the schedule portal.

Here, you will enter your **Unique CAMP ID** , and select a **Day** to receive a custom schedule with:

- Session Timings (in your Time Zone)
- Session Topics
- Session Links (Zoom Links)



## The second being the resources portal.

Here, you will find resources for all aspects of camp – ranging from pre-readings to session recordings to troubleshooting guides.

To navigate this site, click on a “course” topic. You will then be presented by different “folders” of content. Under each section, you will find files, links, and more!


## The third being the support portal.

Here, you will find support for all aspects of camp accessible in 4 ways
